## Overview

When the RM520NGL modem operates in **PCIe/GbE mode** (via the Waveshare carrier board), OpenWrt treats the connection as a plain Ethernet WAN — the modem is invisible to LuCI. This app fills that gap by communicating with the modem directly over its **USB AT command port** (`/dev/ttyUSB2`) and exposing a rich management panel in the LuCI web interface.

**Companion project:** [gl-mt6000-rm520n-auto-config](https://github.com/pajus1337/gl-mt6000-rm520n-auto-config) — the installer that sets up the GbE data path this app is designed to complement.

## Features

- **Signal dashboard** — RSRP bar chart with colour coding, RSSI, SINR, RSRQ; auto-refreshed every 10 s
- **Signal quality badge** — combined RSRP + SINR score: Poor / Fair / Good / Very Good / Excellent
- **Technology badge** — live indicator: `LTE`, `NR5G-NSA`, `NR5G-SA`
- **Modem info** — firmware version, IMEI, LTE and 5G NR registration status, operator, MCC/MNC
- **Cell Info** — RRC state, band, duplex, EARFCN, PCI, TAC; fallbacks from QNWINFO/QCAINFO/CEREG for NOCONN mode
- **Cell ID block** — hex + decimal ECI, decoded eNB ID and sector, direct **CellMapper** deep-link
- **Carrier Aggregation** — lists PCC/SCC with band, EARFCN, PCI, RSRP per component carrier
- **Per-antenna RSRP** — RX0–RX3 individual signal levels with colour coding
- **Temperature panel** — all active modem sensors with colour-coded values (green / amber / orange / red)
- **Data counters** — modem-side TX/RX byte totals via `AT+QGDCNT?`
- **Band configuration** — toggle chip buttons per LTE/NR band, All/None shortcuts, Apply per RAT, Reset All Bands
- **Network mode** — switch between AUTO / LTE / NR5G / LTE:NR5G
- **APN configuration** — change APN without touching UCI
- **Reconnect** — soft reconnect (CFUN=4 → CFUN=1, ~5 s downtime) with confirmation dialog
- **Modem reboot** — full restart (CFUN=1,1, ~20 s) with confirmation dialog
- **Connectivity watchdog** — procd daemon pings a configurable host; on repeated failure runs reconnect, modem reboot, a 3-stage cascade (reconnect → reboot modem → reboot router), or a router reboot outright. Settings shows live status, time since last successful check, and a scrollable event history (with a signal snapshot logged at each action) so failures can be correlated with signal quality

## Requirements

- OpenWrt **25.12** or later
- Quectel **RM520NGL** connected via Waveshare 5G M.2 to GbE carrier board
- USB 3.1 cable from Waveshare board to router USB port (provides `/dev/ttyUSBx`)
- LuCI installed (`luci-base`)

> This app works independently of how the modem's data path is configured (GbE or USB). It only needs the AT command port on `/dev/ttyUSB2`.

---

## Installation

**Option A — One-liner (wget, available on all OpenWrt installs):**
```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pajus1337/luci-app-rm520n/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Option B — Clone and run locally:**
```sh
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/pajus1337/luci-app-rm520n.git
cd luci-app-rm520n
sh install.sh
```

The installer copies files directly to the router filesystem — no OpenWrt build system required.

After installation, open LuCI and navigate to:
**Network → 5G Modem (RM520N)**

**Uninstall** (stops the watchdog and removes the panel; settings in `/etc/config/rm520n` are kept):
```sh
sh install.sh --uninstall
# or
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pajus1337/luci-app-rm520n/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
```

| `refresh` | read | Fast refresh: signal, cell info, CA, per-antenna RSRP (10 s poll) |

| `set_bands` | write | Lock to specific LTE and/or NR bands (`AT+QNWPREFCFG`) |

## Connectivity Watchdog

A procd-managed daemon (`root/usr/sbin/rm520n-watchdog`) pings a configurable host at a fixed
interval and counts consecutive failures. Once the failure threshold is reached it runs one of:

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| `reconnect` | Soft reconnect (CFUN=4 → 1) |
| `reboot_modem` | Full modem restart (`AT+CFUN=1,1`) |
| `cascade` | Escalates one stage per threshold hit: reconnect → reboot modem → reboot router |
| `reboot_router` | Full OpenWrt reboot |

Detection time is `interval × threshold` at minimum (e.g. 10 s × 3 = ~30 s) — a little more under
packet loss, since each failed check itself waits on ping timeouts. Every triggered action is
logged via syslog with a one-line signal snapshot (technology, RSRP, SINR, RRC state, supply
voltage, traffic since the last snapshot, per-SCC signal, and local gateway reachability)
captured at that moment, so repeated events can be correlated with signal quality — and with
whether the modem itself was still reachable — rather than just timestamps.

Configure it under **Network → 5G Modem (RM520N) → Settings**, where you can also see time since
the last successful check and a scrollable history of recent watchdog events.

## Signal Quality Reference

| Metric | Excellent | Very Good | Good | Fair | Poor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSRP | > −80 dBm | > −90 dBm | > −100 dBm | > −110 dBm | ≤ −110 dBm |
| SINR (modifier) | — | — | +1 score if ≥ 10 dB | — | −1 score if < 0 dB |
| RSRQ (display) | > −10 dB | > −15 dB | > −20 dB | ≤ −20 dB | — |

The badge score (1–5) is RSRP-based, then adjusted ±1 by SINR.

## Troubleshooting

**Panel shows no data / AT port not found:**
```sh
ls /dev/ttyUSB*
# If missing, check that USB cable from Waveshare is connected to router USB port
# and that kmod-usb-serial-option is installed
```

**Test AT communication manually:**
```sh
stty -F /dev/ttyUSB2 -opost -onlcr -icrnl min 0 time 3
exec 3<>/dev/ttyUSB2
printf 'AT\r\n' >&3
dd <&3 bs=4096 count=1 2>/dev/null
exec 3>&-
# Should output: OK
```

**Reload rpcd after manual file changes:**
```sh
/etc/init.d/rpcd reload
rm -rf /tmp/luci-indexcache /tmp/luci-modulecache
```

**Band/EARFCN show `—` in Cell Info:**
The modem enters `NOCONN` state on the AT port when data runs over PCIe/GbE. `AT+QENG="servingcell"` returns no cell data in this state. The app falls back to `AT+QNWINFO` (band/EARFCN) and `AT+QCAINFO` (PCI) automatically.

**`wwan_mgmt` shows "Absent" / disconnected in LuCI → Network → Interfaces:**
Expected — this app doesn't use that interface at all. It talks to the modem over the AT/USB port directly, not QMI. If you installed the companion [gl-mt6000-rm520n-auto-config](https://github.com/pajus1337/gl-mt6000-rm520n-auto-config) installer, see its README Troubleshooting section for why that interface exists and why it's never connected.

## Compatibility

| Component | Tested version |
|---|---|
| OpenWrt | 25.12.3, 25.12.6 |
| Modem firmware | RM520NGLAAR03A03M4G |
| LuCI | 26.x (OpenWrt 25.12 default) |

> **Firmware upgrades:** `install.sh` adds the panel files to `/etc/sysupgrade.conf`, so they and
> `/etc/config/rm520n` survive a `sysupgrade` with "keep settings", with or without extroot.
> A stock image does not include `coreutils-stty` or the modem's USB serial driver, so after the
> upgrade reinstall them: `apk update && apk add coreutils-stty kmod-usb-serial-option`. The watchdog is intentionally left stopped until you start it, because without the AT
> port it could only escalate blindly: `/etc/init.d/rm520n-watchdog enable && /etc/init.d/rm520n-watchdog start`.
